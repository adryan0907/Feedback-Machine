This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

# Feedback Machine

The **Feedback Machine** is a school project focused on collecting user input through an interactive minigame. Users can contribute by adding pixels to a grid, similar to Reddit's *r/place*, creating a visual representation of user feedback. The project is built using **React**, **TailwindCSS**, and **TypeScript**.

## Project Purpose

This project aims to explore innovative ways of gathering user input. Instead of traditional forms or surveys, users interact by clicking on a grid to add pixels. This approach creates a unique and playful way to engage users and visualize feedback.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building responsive and stylish designs.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript for enhanced development and more robust code.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the app locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adryan0907/Feedback-Machine.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Feedback-Machine

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install

4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start

Once started, the app will be accessible in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage In the app 
users can click on a pixel in the grid to add it. Each pixel represents a piece of user input, resulting in a visual feedback mechanism. The project serves as a demonstration of how user input can be collected in a playful and engaging way.

## Future Enhancements
No future enhancements are planned, as the project is near completion. The focus is on finalizing the current functionality and presenting the results.
