# Feedback Machine

The **Feedback Machine** is a school project focused on collecting user input through a quick interactive minigame. Users can contribute by adding pixels to a grid as a reward, creating a visual representation of user feedback. The project is built using **React**, **TailwindCSS**, and **TypeScript**.

## Project Purpose

This project aims to explore innovative ways of gathering user input. Instead of traditional forms or surveys, users interact by clicking on a grid to add pixels. This approach creates a unique and playful way to engage users and visualize feedback.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building responsive and stylish designs.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript for enhanced development and more robust code.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the app locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adryan0907/Feedback-Machine.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Feedback-Machine

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install

4. Start the development server:
    ```bash

Once started, the app will be accessible in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage In the app 
users can click on a pixel in the grid to add it. Each pixel represents a piece of user input, resulting in a visual feedback mechanism. The project serves as a demonstration of how user input can be collected in a playful and engaging way.
